# smart-move-planner

Creating a "Smart Move Planner" application involves several components. Below is a simplified version of such a program that includes the ability to input user preferences and access mock data for traffic patterns and housing markets. For this example, weâ€™ll use dummy data and demonstrate how the program might use this data to make recommendations. Note that actual implementation would require access to real-time data sources through APIs, which is beyond the scope of this example.

```python
import random

# Dummy Data
traffic_data = {
    'Downtown': {'congestion_score': 8, 'average_commute_time': 40},
    'Suburb': {'congestion_score': 3, 'average_commute_time': 20},
    'Countryside': {'congestion_score': 1, 'average_commute_time': 35}
}

housing_market_data = {
    'Downtown': {'average_price': 500000, 'price_per_sqft': 300},
    'Suburb': {'average_price': 350000, 'price_per_sqft': 200},
    'Countryside': {'average_price': 250000, 'price_per_sqft': 150}
}

def get_user_preferences():
    """Function to get user preferences for relocation"""
    try:
        budget = int(input('Enter your housing budget: '))
        commute_preference = int(input('Enter preferred maximum commute time (minutes): '))
        price_sensitivity = int(input('On a scale of 1-10, how price-sensitive are you? '))
        traffic_tolerance = int(input('On a scale of 1-10, how much traffic can you tolerate? '))
        return budget, commute_preference, price_sensitivity, traffic_tolerance
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter numerical values for all fields.")
        return None

def recommend_location(budget, commute_preference, price_sensitivity, traffic_tolerance):
    """Function to recommend a location based on user preferences and data"""
    try:
        best_score = -float('inf')
        best_location = None

        for location in traffic_data.keys():
            # Fetch relevant data
            traffic_info = traffic_data[location]
            housing_info = housing_market_data[location]

            # Calculate scores based on user preferences
            price_score = max(0, budget - housing_info['average_price']) * price_sensitivity
            traffic_score = max(0, (commute_preference - traffic_info['average_commute_time'])) * traffic_tolerance
            random_factor = random.uniform(0.5, 1.5)  # Mimic some randomness in the decision, for unpredictability
            
            # Total score
            total_score = (price_score + traffic_score) * random_factor

            if total_score > best_score:
                best_score = total_score
                best_location = location

        return best_location

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during the recommendation process: {e}")
        return None

def smart_move_planner():
    """Main function to orchestrate the Smart Move Planner"""
    print("Welcome to the Smart Move Planner!\n")
    user_preferences = get_user_preferences()

    if user_preferences:
        budget, commute_preference, price_sensitivity, traffic_tolerance = user_preferences
        recommended_location = recommend_location(budget, commute_preference, price_sensitivity, traffic_tolerance)

        if recommended_location:
            print(f"\nBased on your preferences, we recommend considering relocating to {recommended_location}.")
        else:
            print("\nWe could not determine an optimal location based on the provided information.")
    else:
        print("\nFailed to process user preferences. Please try again.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    smart_move_planner()
```

### Important Points:
- **Error Handling:** Error handling is included around user input and the recommendation algorithm to catch and report any issues.
- **User Interaction:** The program captures user preferences related to budget and tolerance for commute and traffic.
- **Decision System:** A simple scoring system calculates potential scores based on user preferences and random factors to make location recommendations.
- **Data Variables:** The traffic and housing data are hardcoded as mock data. For real applications, you would replace this with data fetched from reliable sources or APIs.

This example should provide you with a foundational understanding of how such an application could be structured in Python. For a real-world application, you'd need to consider using web frameworks, database connections, and API integrations to handle real data.
